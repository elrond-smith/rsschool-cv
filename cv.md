## About me
I'm 33 years old, I live in Vitebsk, Belarus. I am fond of programming and initially it was as a hobby for the soul, 
but now I realized that I am ready to change my specialization and go to IT, because I feel in my place. At the moment 
I work as a System Administrator in a government agency.

I learn quickly enough and grasp any information on the fly, trying to apply it in real or educational projects, and 
I always try to understand the essence of the problem with broken code, so as not to make mistakes in the future. 
I'm in constant learning, because programming is constantly changing, and I like it.
